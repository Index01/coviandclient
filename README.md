# Android Covid-19 Social Personal Responsibility Application.

Welcome to the pandemic. There now exists a plethora of Covid-19 contact tracing apps, all hungrily eating your battery as they use wifi, bluetooth and GPS to correlate viral spread. Resulting in non-transparent personal information usage. 
Instead, this application places responsibility in the hands of the users. 
* Create entries when you have a high risk or high exposure enccounter. 
* Share your encounters from the last two weeks. 
* Make informed decisions about who you see and who maybe needs to chill for a min. 



### Status
The application is in semi-public beta testing. Mesage for links. Source code is posted here because hey opensource we like transparency.
