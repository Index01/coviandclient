# Android Covid-19 Social Personal Responsibility Application.

Welcome to the pandemic. There now exists a plethora of Covid-19 contact tracing apps, all hungrily eating your battery as they use wifi, bluetooth and GPS to correlate viral spread. Resulting in non-transparent personal information usage. 
Instead, this application places responsibility in the hands of the users. 
* Create entries when you have a high risk or high exposure enccounter. 
* Share your encounters from the last two weeks. 
* Make informed decisions about who you see and who maybe needs to chill for a min.

### Technical
Navigate to the https://github.com/Index01/coviandclient/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/covilyfe/v1r0 folder and children for code. The project is structured to run in Android Studio, commandline is fine as well. https://github.com/Index01/coviapi is the server api, written in Flask with Postgres, transport is json. Credentials are self signed(rsa2048,x509,v1.3), since I control client distro adding CAs aint no thang.

### Status
The application is in semi-public beta testing. Mesage for links. Source code is posted here because hey opensource we like transparency.
